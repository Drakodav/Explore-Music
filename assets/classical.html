			<h2> Classical Music? </h2>
			<p>When asked, "What is Classical Music?", in many people's mind they think of 'elevator music'. Although this is widly 
			 innacurate, it is only used as a generic term, both words are fairly similar. They both refer to a type of music,
			 Classical Music encompasses styles of music spanning as much as over 700 years.</p>

			<h2>Don't Hesitate</h2>
			<p>The sheer breadth of Classical Music can be overwhelming and seem too much to try and explore,
				but as soon as you find something that you enjoy, keep listening to it, nowadays you can start a station on
				many of the modern music platforms such as Spotify or Soundcloud. The 'Station' feature will play similar content 
				to what you are listening and will allow you to expand and discover more of the music that you enjoy.
				Here is a spotify playlist that can help.
