          <h2> Music in 2017? </h2>
		  <p> Music has come a long way since its humble beginnings, but for those living under a rock for the past year,
				this <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/13-songs-that-defined-music-in-2017">article</a> does a great job at 
				showcasing the 2017 musical year very well. But what exactly sets today's 'Modern Music' apart from that of the
				2000's? Do you remember listening to music on every single commute?, on every single journey?, do you remember 
				listening to a song where the artist tries hard but can still make musical mistakes?, how about having to buy your music?
				The way we listen to music has changed, but also how music is made.
		  </p>
		  
		  <h2> Technology</h2>
		  <p>Throughout the recent musical history, 'Autotune', has been perpetually known to have been used by innumerable artists,
				this paved the path for average musicians to sound flawless. This uprising trend from the 00's to 10's has been widely
				disputed and debated, some critics have criticised while some have praised it. While it can cover up an artists bad performance, 
				it can also allow for experimental music. But it seems like nowadays the social stigma is that everyone who uses 'Autotune' 
				cannot sing at all. The video below is a great brief on the history of Autotune.

		  <h2> Repetition </h2>
		  <p>  Do you remember Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen? That in my opinion is the least repetitive song there is. Today's social norm 
				is plain repetition. The song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E"> 'This is what you came for' </a> by Calvin
				Harris ft. Rihanna, is a very repetitive song, just by looking at the 
				<a href="https://genius.com/Calvin-harris-this-is-what-you-came-for-lyrics"> lyrics </a> or simply listening to it, you cannot doubt that
				artists today are getting too lazy. Mainstream songs nowadays get very repetitive, but withouth a doubt we as listeners 
				are also quite compelled to listen to such catchy songs that you can sing along to within seconds. Below is a great brief on why 
				we listen to repetitive music.

		  <h2> The Verdict </h2>
		  <p> Whilst mainstream music has gotten quite 'basic', to put it that way, the pro's are that making music is now more accesible than ever,
				 simple upload to youtube or soundcloud can make you viral in no time, overnight you can become famous. Social media eliminates the middle 
				 man such as record labels and radio to get your song heard, if people like it then your good to go.
		  </p>
		  <p> Alot changed since the older time, we can now listen to any song we feel like on the go, we have so much choice its overwhelming.
					Popular music tends to be simpler and more immediately accessible, and is a lot more lucrative, so it gets more publicity, but less respect. 
					Classical music is more prestigious and its listeners tend to listen to it harder than pop music fans listen to pop music, but less people like it. 
					What I'd do, is explore the unknown, start with the middle man, Jazz is the perfect mixture between the two, what you'll find id that it's
					actually a very relaxing type of music. Start with a playlist while you just doing the chores around the house.
