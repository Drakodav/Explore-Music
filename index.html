          <p>   <a href="http://kmit.in/emagazine/article/the-gift-of-music/">“Music is life, it’s a haven”. </a> 
				I say this personally and I feel that in the time of today many people can relate to this quote.
				Music has become inseparable with our daily lives, we listen to music so often and for so many different purposes that one could
				say we developed an addiction to it. In the past, music was something people listened to when they had leisure,
				but today it is simultaneously played while doing almost anything. That is the beauty of music that people from the past 
				could never imagine unless they see it with their own eyes. </p>
                   
          <p>	Music can heal and disrupt, it can wither bring the best or the worst out of us, it can make us dance/rave/sing or it can put us 
				to sleep. And thus listening to music can really affect us on a personal level, that is why in my opinion one should try explore and 
				understand music in a deeper context.						</p>
          
          <p>	Academics is an area where music can improve the life of a student, not only for those pursuing a career in music, 
				but any person that is trying to focus or study. You can find many examples online of playlists that allow you to concentrate better 
				whilst studying, personally I find it better when relaxing music fills the space rather than an empty sounding room.
				There are many online tips for what to listen to when your simply trying to 
				<a href="https://www.goconqr.com/en/examtime/blog/music-for-studying/"> study </a> or 
				<a href="https://soundscapemusictherapy.com/2011/09/29/five-tips-for-choosing-music-to-help-your-body-relax/"> relax. </a>
				I, having had experience, can say that for a student it can make a very big and positive difference in the most intense and of 
				stressful of times while in studying.</p>
          
          <p>	Music is being produced all over the world, by every culture known to mankind. 
				Thus, listening to a different variety of music will make one know more about different cultures other than  
				the one surrounding their bubble. One can also have an idea about various flavours around the globe. 
				We can learn musical traditions, musical instruments, history of that culture and more.      
				Tastes and interests in the same genre of music often bring people together; 
				this can help build up communities. Learning that a person has the same interest as you do can make you 
				build a bond and have a healthy relationship between friends. 
				Music is also enjoyed publicly, at concerts and dance clubs, where people can bond really closely.</p>	
				
          <p>	On the whole, I feel that this five letter word plays the most important role in many of our lives. It’s become form of addiction; 
				of benefit for a few and vital to for others. It has become a bond between people and cultures.
				What I feel is important now is that we understand more about how the music that we listen to came about.</p>
